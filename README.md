This was my final project, completed under the guidance of Dr. Kevin Austin. I developed it to demonstrate my understanding of core Python concepts, including data analysis, file handling, and visualization using Matplotlib.

The program takes user input related to seismic events—such as earthquakes, explosions, nuclear explosions, and rock bursts—and performs a detailed analysis. It then generates visualizations, graphs, and identifies cities within a certain radius that may be affected.

I worked with CSV data files, cleaning them by filtering out bad data and replacing missing or invalid values with defaults to avoid losing valuable rows. I used Python data structures like lists and dictionaries to organize and access the data efficiently after converting it into a structured format.
